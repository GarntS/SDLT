<--------->
SDLight (aka SDLT) is a lightweight, object-oriented game engine. It was created by me with the intent of learning how game engines worked in practice as well as learning proper engine design patterns. Despite the fact that this was written in past tense, I am still actively working on this project and trying to improve it. Criticism is exected and encouraged.

With all of that said, it it definitely isn't prefectly written so I wouldn't reccommend using as a part of a large project.
